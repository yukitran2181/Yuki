# WELCOME TO MY PROFILE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Yuki, a person who loves telling stories beyond many complex numbers. I've got a Master degree in Business Administration from I- Shou University and took some extra courses to improving my data skills.

In previous roles, I used my detailed analysis of customer, sales, and marketing data to create meaningful reports that helped stakeholders understand our customers and optimize sales operations.

In line with my career aspirations, I am eager to challenge myself with data in a variety of fields, such as banking, retail, and logistics. I am also interested in exploring exercises related to prediction using machine learning.
